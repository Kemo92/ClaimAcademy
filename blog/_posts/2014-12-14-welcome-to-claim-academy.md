##Welcome to Claim Academy!


We're beginning something big here at 515 Olive St. We're going to change the way St. Louis views programming and technical education. We're going to change the way the world views St. Louis as a tech hub. And we're going to change the way that businesses interact with tech talent in this city.

And you're here with us, right at the beginning! Thank you.

When people talk about the great technology centers of the United States, cities in the Midwest are rarely mentioned. Our cities are seen as relics from a different technlogical age; communities whose Golden Ages were built on assembly lines and in manufacturing plants. Today, our economy is not centered on factories, but on technologies. Gone are the days of middle-class tradesmen working behind welding machines, industrial lathes, and conveyor belts. Today's tradesmen are creating products in smaller teams, for larger markets, without any physical product outside of a server.

While the Midwest has been slow to shift to this new economy, it's not hard to imagine the benefits of an agressive shift towards a strong local economy of progammers, startups, and software developement for the next generation. Computer literate and creative thinkers will be the drivers of the next American economy. The hard part is producing enough of these folks to keep up with the world's demand. The communities that can shift from a 20th century to 21st century economy fastest will be the most vibrant, successful, and talked-about communities of the next century. 

Personally, we'd love to live in one of those cities. And we're hoping that you'll help us build it.
