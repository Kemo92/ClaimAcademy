title: "The Application Process"
---

So you're ready to apply to Claim Academy. Congratulations! We're glad you're interested in one (or more) of our classes. Here's a step-by-step guide through our application process:

##Step 1: Apply Online
There's just one application for all of our classes. Fill it out [here](http://claimacademystl.com/html/signup.html).


##Step 2: In-person interview (3 weeks before classes start)
We need to meet you in person! In the beginning of January, we'll let you know if you've made it to this stage of the application process.
All interviews will be held at our downtown St. Louis location at [515 Olive St #600](http://workatclaim.com).


##Step 3: Technical challenge (3 weeks before classes start)
At your in-person interview, we'll send you home with a technical challenge.
Technical challenges will vary by class. You are more than welcome to apply for multiple classes, but you may be asked to complete multiple technical challenges.


##Step 4: Pair programming (2 weeks before classes start)
Once we've reviewed your technical challenge we'll pare down the list of applicants even further.
The strongest applicants will be invited to interview with one of our [instructors or mentors](http://claimacademystl.com/teachers.html) in front of some code to evaluate how well you work in front of a computer as a part of a team.


##Step 5: Final Decision and Placement
After your pair programming interview, your [instructor or mentor](http://claimacademystl.com/teachers.html) will recommend either that we reject your application or that you be placed in one of our classes.
If you applied for multiple classes in the same cohort, your pair-programming instructor will recommend placement in the class that would be most beneficial to you.
If accepted to our program, we will inform you which class you are accepted to and whether or not you have received scholarships or financial aid.


##Step 6: Starting Class
After you've been accepted to the program, tuition fees are due within 48hours of acceptance to reserve your spot.

Don't forget, if your application is rejected, we will keep your information on file and encourage you to apply for future classes. We're more than happy to reevaluate your applications until we can find a good fit for you!
