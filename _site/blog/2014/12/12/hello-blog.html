<p>For our first post, we’d like to introduce the executive team behind the scenes of Claim Academy. You’ll certainly get to spend a lot of time with your instructors and mentors, but you might not often interact with some of the folks that make this organization run behind the scenes.</p>

<h3 id="ola-ayeni">Ola Ayeni</h3>
<p>Ola is the CEO and founder of St. Louis start-ups eateria and Claim, and provides a lot of the business guidance that Claim Academy needs outside of the classroom. Eateria is St. Louis’ premiere email, social media, and SMS marketing company specifically for restaurants. Ola also prefers tea over coffee.</p>
