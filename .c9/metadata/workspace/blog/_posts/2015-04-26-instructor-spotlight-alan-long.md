Giving them an easy way to maintain their web presence would prevent them needed to invest resources to update their web sites, and could hopefully focus more resources on housing and caring for the animals they have.

While not without it's problems, I feel that an MVC architecture is a superior software architecture for working over a stateless protocol like HTTP, despite the good job of abstraction & state persistence that Web Forms provided.","","Microsoft has also made another massive change recently with the open sourcing of .NET.
